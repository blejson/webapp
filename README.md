This is my first web app made in spring, currently in development. 
It imitates social network sites like Facebook.
Currently implemented functionalities are: 
- creating new users, logging into site with created accounts (Spring Security)
- adding posts, saving them in database (SQL, JPA)
- displaying posts in home page
- displaying specific user's posts at user's page
- adding other users into friends list
